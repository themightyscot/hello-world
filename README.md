# hello-world
my first GitHub repository

hey this is my first project on github.  sophie told me it was awesome and a few years later, here i am, trying it out.  i like not using caps in case you hadn't noticed.  cs290 (a web development class taught in html, css, and node.js) at osu made me make this for the class but i bet i'll use it for a lot more than that.  watch out world, and hello.
